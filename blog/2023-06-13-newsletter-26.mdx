We release QuestDB 7.2! Find out more about new and upcoming features. Javier
will speak at the BEAM summit, and the QuestDB team will attend Berlin
Buzzwords.

## QuestDB 7.2

We introduce partition split to reduce the surface area for copy-on-write
operations. This minimizes write amplification and improves performance by
orders of magnitude during heavy out-of-order data ingest scenarios. Read the
[release notes](https://github.com/questdb/questdb/releases/tag/7.2) to find out
more.

## ðŸ†• New features

- [Superset](/blog/time-series-data-visualization-apache-superset-and-questdb/)
  integration is available.
- New [CSV upload UI](/docs/develop/web-console/#import)

- Durability: A new f-sync mode for less predictable on-prem deployments. This
  ensures that committed transactions and data changes are not lost or corrupted
  during a crash or power loss. The impact on performance is roughly 2x slower
  ingests.

## ðŸ‘€ Coming very soon for Cloud and Enterprise

- Data Compression will soon be available for QuestDB Cloud! Expect 3x less
  space on disk (more than 10x for nulls).

- Role-Based Access Control with user/role management, table/column-level
  permissions, In-database access key management, and OAuth.

## ðŸ™Œ Community

- Javier will speak at the BEAM Summit in New York on June 14, 12:00-12:25 EDT.

  design decisions and trade-offs we made to build QuestDB.
